# XGPS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rveshovda/xgps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rveshovda/xgps)
[![Hex version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/xgps.svg "Hex version")](https://hex.pm/packages/xgps)

GPS for Elixir

XGPS runs as an application and will start along with you application, and connect to an serial port to get GPS data.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `xgps` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:xgps, "~> 0.4.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `xgps` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:xgps]]
    end
    ```

  3. To make an effort to be platform independent, XGPS uses [nerves_uart](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_uart) for the dirty details. Please make sure to follow the instructions for nerves_uart to make this compile and run on your system.

## Usage: start
### Manually
Simply call:

  ```elixir
  XGPS.Ports.start_port("name-of-port")
  ```

### Config
Add a line like this in you config:

  ```elixir
  config :xgps, port_to_start: {"name-of-port"}
  ```

### Config with init
If you are using the Adafruit Ultimate GPS you can add:

  ```elixir
  config :xgps, port_to_start: {"name-of-port", :init_adafruit_gps}
  ```

This will send a series of commands to your GPS to configure it.
The following commands are then sent:
- "$PMTK313,1*2E" => enable SBAS
- "$PMTK319,1*24" => Set SBAS to not test mode
- "$PMTK301,2*2E" => Enable SBAS to be used for DGPS
- "$PMTK286,1*23" => Enable AIC (anti-inteference)
- "$PMTK314,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0*28" => Output only RMC & GGA
- "$PMTK397,0*23" => Disable nav-speed threshold

These sentences will work to initialize other GPS-types supporting the PMTK command types.

## Usage: Get position

### Manually
This usage pattern is mostly for testing.
Call:

  ```elixir
  XGPS.Ports.get_one_position
  ```

to get the latest fixed positions.

Pay attention to the has_fix if it is true or false. If has_fix=false, you cannot trust the other values.

### Automatically (GenStage)
The most common usage pattern is to subscribe to the GenStage producer running.
Check out the code inside the example-folder for an implementation for a subscriber. You need to implement (or copy) similar code to your side to receive new positions.

## Usage: simulation

### Starting manually
Start a simulated port by calling the following:
```elixir
XGPS.Ports.start_port(:simulate)
```

### Auto-start from config
By adding a line to config:
```elixir
config :xgps, port_to_start: {:simulate,}
```

### Sending simulated position
Send a simulated position using one of the following commands:
```elixir
XGPS.Ports.send_simulated_no_fix()
XGPS.Ports.send_simulated_position(1.1,2.2,3.3) # lat, lon, alt
```

## Future development
- Simulation reading from file

## Note
This application was tested on a Raspberry Pi using the AdaFruit Ultimate GPS ([1](https://www.adafruit.com/products/746), [2](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2324)), which essentially uses the chip MTK3339. Guarantees for other systems and chips cannot be given. But please provide feedback if working or not on other systems/chips.
