# Usage: Make a copy of this file and include in your project.
# Provide a path to your file when starting simulator.

#
# Format: LAT, LON, ALT \n
# All positions will be sent with 1 second between them.
#
# If you need a specific time with each position, for test-cases;
# Format: LAT, LON, ALT, TIMESTAMP
#
# Both LAT and LOT must be given as decimal degrees,
# TIMESTAMP like this: 2022-10-02T06:12:13
#
# TIMESTAMP will *always* be interpreted as UTC,
#
# If TIMESTAMP is not given, system time is sent.
# A mix of position with and without TIMESTAMP will be accepted and started.
# But you will probably want to either give all with TIMESTAMP or not.
#
# Example without TIMESTAMP:
# 1.1 , 2.2, 3.3
#
# Example with TIMESTAMP:
# 1.1 , 2.2, 3.3 , 2022-10-02T06:12:13

1.1, 2.2, 3.3
4.4, 5.5, 6.6
7.7, 8.8, 9.9
